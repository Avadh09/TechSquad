Over the course of two weeks in mid-to late February they travel to every office to present the prior years results and to preview the coming year from a strategic and financial perspective. EVERY employee in the firm is invited to attend to hear from firm leadership in great detail how Cooley is doing and what the firm hopes to achieve together going forward. The level of detail and transparency is remarkable and likely unmatched among the leading law firms with whom Cooley competes."

    "Employees_say_2": "Culturally, people here are genuinely interested in celebrating each others successes without any self interest (e.g., desire to steal credit, etc.). People are also very interested in helping each other succeed. It is common that when I ask someone for help, they are happy to drop whatever important work they are doing. I get the impression that they receive a lot of joy from helping me work through something I was having difficulty on my own. It feels like a deep-rooted cultural norm here at Dropbox. Ive never experienced anything like it, but now that I have, I would hate to lose it."

    "Employees_say_2": "As employees, we have a lot of autonomy. The individual product owners have freedom to make judgement calls on a lot of projects, and the individual team members have the freedom to make judgement calls on a lot of tickets. This makes us quicker and more flexible as an organization and also lets the teams feel like they are in control of the work theyre doing."

    "Employees_say_2": "What strikes me as most unique about ShareThis is the level of transparency throughout the ranks. Ive never worked at a place where the CEO gives monthly updates detailing all aspects of the business: the financials, the good news, the bad news, etc. The CEO also makes himself available at any time to anyone, so there are few secrets. This transparency helps make everyone feel like were working on the same problems together and keeps us from speculating. Its the healthiest work environment Ive been a part of."
